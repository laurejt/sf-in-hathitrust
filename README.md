Speculative Fiction in HathiTrust
=================================
This repository is a growing resource for speculative fiction (SF) works
in the [HathiTrust Digital Library](https://www.hathitrust.org).

It is a continuation of the resource collected in the [HTRC ACS 2019 project](https://wiki.htrc.illinois.edu/display/COM/Advanced+Collaborative+Support+%28ACS%29+Awards#2019) "Building Large-Scale Collections of Genre Fiction" by Laure Thompson and David Mimno.
For more details, see the [Final Project Report](https://wiki.htrc.illinois.edu/download/attachments/31588360/HTRC%20ACS%20Final%20Reportv2.pdf?version=1&modificationDate=1605782898000&api=v2), as well as the [ACH 2021 presentation slides](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~laurejt/slides/ACH_2021.pdf) for "Finding Speculative Fiction in HathiTrust" by Laure Thompson and David Mimno.

If you have any questions, you can contact Laure Thompson at laurejt@cs.umass.edu
